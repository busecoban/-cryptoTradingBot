### Trading Strategies

1. **Bollinger Bands**:  
   - Consists of a middle band (typically a 20-period SMA) and two outer bands, which are two standard deviations above and below the middle band.  
   - Used to measure market volatility and indicate how far a price might move from its average.

2. **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**:  
   - Measures the magnitude of recent price changes to determine whether an asset is overbought or oversold.  
   - Values above 70 typically indicate overbought conditions, while values below 30 indicate oversold conditions.

3. **SMA (Simple Moving Average)**:  
   - The average of a securityâ€™s price over a set number of periods.  
   - Smooths out price data to identify trends over time.

4. **EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**:  
   - Similar to SMA but gives more weight to recent price data, making it more responsive to price changes.  
   - Often used to identify market trends.

5. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**:  
   - A trend-following indicator measuring the difference between a fast EMA (12-period) and a slow EMA (26-period).  
   - A signal line (usually a 9-period EMA) is plotted to identify buy or sell signals.

6. **SuperTrend**:  
   - Used to identify trends based on price action and volatility.  
   - It is plotted as a trailing stop for long or short trades, indicating trend direction.

7. **DMI (Directional Movement Index)**:  
   - Measures the strength of a price trend and consists of two lines:  
     - **+DI**: Positive directional indicator (upward trend).  
     - **-DI**: Negative directional indicator (downward trend).  
   - When +DI is above -DI, it suggests an upward trend, and when -DI is above +DI, it suggests a downward trend.
